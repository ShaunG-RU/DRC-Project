# Dynamic Range Compressor (DRC) Design Project

## Overview

This repository hosts the development files for a Dynamic Range Compressor (DRC) aimed at audio signals. The project is currently under development, focusing on the design and simulation stages. It involves a comprehensive approach to understanding and implementing DRC in the audio frequency range.

The latest compiled paper is available [here](./LaTeX/main.pdf).
